```
---
- name: Deploy Docker Compose project
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    project_name: my_project
    project_path: /path/to/my_project

  tasks:
    - name: Install Docker Compose
      apt:
        name: docker-compose
        state: present

    - name: Copy Docker Compose file
      copy:
        src: docker-compose.yml
        dest: "{{ project_path }}/docker-compose.yml"

server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
```

# Create a new directory named files in the same directory as your playbook

mkdir files
```

# Copy your Docker Compose file to the files directory
